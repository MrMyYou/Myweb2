[**Research Experience**]

Jul 2023 – Sep 2023 **A 4×25Gb/s VCSEL Driver with Nonlinear Equalization.** In this project, my job is to confirm the principle of equalization and debug timing problem existing in previous version. In addition, I provided an idea that can improve performance while keeping the load constant.

Dec 2021 – Apr 2022 **A 4×56Gb/s Large-Swing Push-Pull CMOS Transmitter for Silicon-Photonic Mach-Zehnder Modulators.** As the project manager, I am dedicated to chip top floorplan and driver stage circuit design, including schematic design and simulation, layout floorplan and drawing,PCB design and chip testing.

Aug 2020 – Nov 2021 **A Silicon-Photonic Microring-based 50/100Gb/s NRZ/PAM-4 Transceiver with Nonlinear Equalization.** As the project manager, I devoted myself to transmitter chip, my responsibilities include technology library installation, PDK documents reading, chip architecture design, chip power management, equalization principle verification, schematic design and simulation, layout floorplan and drawing, PCB design and chip testing[1].

Jan 2020 – Jul 2020 **A 4× 25 Gb/s De-Serializer with Baud-Rate Sampling CDR and Standing-Wave Clock Distribution for NIC Optical Interconnects.** In this project, I am committed to designing entire clock distribution system who delivers a low-jitter 12.5GHz clock to all four channels across a 2.2mm distance under low power consumption and provides sampling clock for the CDR[2].
