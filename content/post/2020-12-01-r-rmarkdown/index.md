[**Research Experience**]

Jul 2023 – Sep 2023 **A 4×25Gb/s VCSEL Driver with Nonlinear Equalization.** 

--Implemented the advanced equalization techniques in the system.

--Successfully identified and solved the DFF sampling timing issues in the previous project.

--Proposed a design technique that improves 50% equalization performance by changing proportion of  equalization circuits. 

Dec 2021 – Apr 2022 **A 4×56Gb/s Large-Swing Push-Pull CMOS Transmitter for Silicon-Photonic Mach-Zehnder Modulators.** 

--Led and managed the whole cycle of this project, including chip floor plan, architecture development, detailed circuit and layout design.

--Developed the test plan and designed the testing PCB of this circuit.

--Simulation results shows the chip achieved 56Gbps data rate, 3Vpp output swing and  3ps pk-pk jitter.

Aug 2020 – Nov 2021 **A Silicon-Photonic Microring-based 50/100Gb/s NRZ/PAM-4 Transceiver with Nonlinear Equalization.** 

--Full-cycle transmitter design in 45RFSOI technology, using look up table architecture (Floor planning, circuit and layout design, verification and testing).

--Closed worked with RX designer to define the scope of the project, specs definition, and system level integration.

--The transmitter was successfully tested with 32Gb/s electrical and 25Gb/s optical performance (50Gb/s potential), less than 3ps pk-pk Jitter and 4Vpp output swing. (2023 IEEE TCAS-I).[1].

Jan 2020 – Jul 2020 **A 4× 25 Gb/s De-Serializer with Baud-Rate Sampling CDR and Standing-Wave Clock Distribution for NIC Optical Interconnects.**

--Designed the clock distribution circuits, which deliver the clock to four channels across 2.2 mm distance using standing-wave based current mode logic structure in 40nm CMOS. 

--The clock distribution circuits delivered 12.5 GHz clock and achieved 6.5mW power consumption, 1.5ps RMS jitter and -96.99dBc/Hz phase noise at 1MHz.  (2021 IEEE ICTA best paper nomination).[2].
