[**Experience**]

Jul 2023 – Oct 2023 **A 4×25Gb/s VCSEL Driver with Nonlinear Equalization** 

--Implemented the advanced equalization techniques in the system.

--Successfully identified and solved the DFF sampling timing issues in the previous project.

--Proposed a design technique that improves 50% equalization performance by changing proportion of  equalization circuits. 

Sep 2021 – Nov 2022 **A Si-Photonic Microring-based 50Gb/s Transceiver with Nonlinear Equalization** 

--Closed worked with RX designer to define the scope of the project, specs definition, and system level integration.

--Clock circuits design in CDR chip and full-cycle transmitter design, using look up table architecture in 45nm CMOS SOI technology (Chip floor planning, architecture development, detailed circuit and layout design, verification and
testing).

--The transmitter was successfully tested with 32Gb/s electrical and 25Gb/s optical performance (50Gb/s potential), less than 3ps pk-pk Jitter and 4Vpp output swing. **(2023 IEEE TCAS-I)**[1].

Oct 2020 – Aug 2021 **A 4× 25 Gb/s De-Serializer with Baud-Rate Sampling CDR and Standing-Wave Clock Distribution for NIC Optical Interconnects.**

--Designed the clock distribution circuits, which deliver the clock to four channels across 2.2 mm distance using standing-wave based current mode logic structure in 40nm CMOS. 

--The clock distribution circuits delivered 12.5 GHz clock and achieved 6.5mW power consumption, 1.5ps RMS jitter and -96.99dBc/Hz phase noise at 1MHz.  **(2021 IEEE ICTA best paper nomination)**[2].
